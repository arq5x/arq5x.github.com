  bio: 
  > 
    Currently, my research is focused on understanding the landscape 
    of de novo mutation in the human genome. Using deep sequencing data 
    from large, multi-generational pedigrees, I am developing an accurate 
    estimate of the human mutation rate, and assessing the influence of 
    relevant molecular processes (recombination, DNA replication, etc.) 
    on this rate. Previously, as part of a collaboration with Nels Eldeâ€™s 
    lab, I used the Oxford Nanopore sequencing platform to investigate 
    adaptive structural variation in evolving poxvirus genomes.
