description: Uphold your DUP and DEL calls. SV callers like lumpy look at split-reads and pair distances to find structural variants. This tool is a fast way to add depth information to those calls. This can be used as additional information for filtering variants; for example we will be skeptical of deletion calls that do not have lower than average coverage compared to regions with similar gc-content.
