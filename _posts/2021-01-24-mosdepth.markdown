description: Fast BAM/CRAM depth calculation for WGS, exome, or targeted sequencing. <code>mosdepth</code> can output...<ul>
    <li>per-base depth about 2x as fast samtools depth--about 25 minutes of CPU time for a 30X genome.</li>
    <li>mean per-window depth given a window size--as would be used for CNV calling.</li>
    <li>the mean per-region given a BED file of regions.</li>
    <li>the mean or median per-region cumulative coverage histogram given a window size</li>
    <li>a distribution of proportion of bases covered at or above a given threshold for each chromosome and genome-wide.</li>
    <li>quantized output that merges adjacent bases as long as they fall in the same coverage bins e.g. (10-20)</li>
    <li>threshold output to indicate how many bases in each region are covered at the given thresholds.</li>
    <li>A summary of mean depths per chromosome and within specified regions per chromosome.</li>
    <li>a d4 file (better than bigwig).</li></ul>
