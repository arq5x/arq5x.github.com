description: OncoGEMINI is an adaptation of GEMINI intended for the improved identification of biologically and clincally relevant tumor variants from multi-sample and longitudinal tumor sequencing data. Using a GEMINI-compatible database (generated from an annotated VCF file), OncoGEMINI is able to filter tumor variants based on included genomic annotations and various allele frequency signatures.
